To use higher-level api include <katcp.h> and link against -lkatcp. 
You might also need to include <katcl.h>, particularly for lower
layer work.

You may need to set the include search path with -I and library
search path with -L

The makefile only generates a static library (.a), but shared
libraries could also be built (but do remember the -fPIC
compiler flag)

The katcp API has several "layers"

 - A top level where the service main loop is implemented 
   inside an API function. An example which uses this
   API can be found in ../examples/server-example.c code. 
   The tcpborphserver and kcs source tree also use this
   api.

   At this level, the user only provides function and sensor
   callbacks. The mainloop is implemented by the library,
   as is the logic to handle network connections.

   The API consists of the following functions:
   
   * A user of this API initialises the system using 
     startup_katcp. 
   
   * Command callbacks are registered using the 
     register_katcp call. 
     
   * To register sensors, use one of the 
     register_*_sensor_katcp functions. 
   
   * After all callbacks are registered, the main loop is started with
     functions such as run_server_katcp, run_multi_server_katcp and run_client_katcp.
   
   * After the main loop completes, final clean ups are done
     by invoking the shutdown_katcp function.

   Inside a command function (the one passed to
   register_katcp), users can call arg_*_katcp
   to access parameters and append_*_katcp, send_katcp
   and log_message_katcp to generate output. 

   Internally the katcp library implements these 
   functions in loop.c and netc.c.

 - An intermediate level, where the user implements his
   or her own main loop (probably using some select
   variant), but still uses a katcp_dispatch structure
   to register functions, dispatch them, etc. The
   internals of a command function remain similar to
   the higher level case (arg_*_katcp, append_*_katcp, etc).

   This logic is implemented inside dispatch.c, but loop.c
   may be helpful as a starting point for a users own 
   main loop.

   This layer is likely to be the least stable.

 - A lower level where only the protocol parsing logic of
   the library is used. Here the programmer implements
   his or her own main loop and dispatch logic. The functions
   used to parse the protocol are defined in line.c and parse and
   are distinguished by a *_katcl (*not* a *_katcp) suffix. Thus
   it is probably sufficient to include only katcl.h. kcpcmd 
   and the much simpler kcpmsg use this layer. 

In addition, there is work underway to develop a duplex
routine, where clients can issue and respond to katcp requests, 
this is still incomplete and makes reasonably large changes
to the library internals. The lowest layer and the command 
registration of the top layer should remain reasonably consistent,
but sensor handling may end up changing.
