This package contains a C katcp library implementation and selected
applications using it. Unless otherwise noted the code base is released
under the terms described in COPYING

The Makefile.inc file in this directory contains a number of options,
edit to your needs

General purpose components:

  katcp       - the katcp library itself
  cmd         - send arbitrary katcp commands to a remote server
  log         - a utility to monitor a remote katcp server
  msg         - something to generate katcp log messages (glue logic)
  par         - similar to cmd, but talk to multiple devices in parallel
  con         - run concurrent subprocesses
  sq          - simple katcp sensor query utility which blocks until 
                a sensor changes to a specified status
  examples    - simple examples 

Applications for roaches:

  tcpborphserver3 
              - roach2 server using memory mapped logic. Requires a kernel
                with a mmap driver and a roach2

  bulkread    - a utlity to perform a ?bulkread request

Project specific code, requring particular gateware and instruments:

  kcs         - a control server using katcp 
                (incomplete)
  scripts     - supporting logic to interface kcs to corr 
                (used by kcs, temporary hack)
  tmon        - monitor a local ntp server via katcp 
                (used by kcs)
  fmon        - fengine monitoring utility to poll gateware status registers 
                (used by kcs)
  wops        - (incomplete & ignore)
